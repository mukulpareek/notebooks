    "# Using Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is just a regular .py file that you run on the Anaconda prompt with `python script.py`.  When run, the script automatically starts a webserver as the script will contain a command calling a Flask app/object. \n",
    "\n",
    "URLs to refer:  \n",
    "1. https://realpython.com/python-web-applications/  \n",
    "2. https://towardsdatascience.com/python-webserver-with-flask-and-raspberry-pi-398423cc6f5d  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### First, standard pieces   \n",
    "#### Top  \n",
    "A Flask script file has some initial standard commands that import libraries, and initialize a Flask app.  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, request, escape, render_template\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Bottom\n",
    "At the bottom of the script is a standard statement\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run(host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=80, debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you change the host to 127.0.0.1, then the webserver is only reachable on the localhost, and not the rest of the network.  To allow everyone on the network to access, use host=0.0.0.0.  Port can be set to anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Second, the middle  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the middle are a bunch of functions that get executed when a particular URL is called from any browser.  This particular URL is identified in the `@app.route(...)` command.  The below is \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.route(\"/\", methods = [\"GET\",\"POST\"])\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "    return('something')  # 'something' then shows up in the browser.\n",
    "    return render_template('index.html').\n",
    "```\n",
    "***  \n",
    "#### The Details\n",
    "The above is the simple part. Couple of additional things:  \n",
    "\n",
    "You create two subdirectories under where the Python script is.  Called 'templates' and 'static'.  The first one you can't change the name, and you keep your html files there that are called by the different functions that are connected to URLs.  The second you use for keeping CSS files.  For CSS example see first example.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "In your function under the @app.route command, whatever you `return` will be displayed on the browser.  You could surround the text with html tags such as `<h1>...</h1>`.  Good enough for basic text.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "However to display more complex html, it is best to create a separate HTML file and call it using `render_template`.  In the HTML file, the dynamic components you keep as variables in the form `{{ variable1 }}`, just like in a mail-merge email.  These python will replace by real values of the variables before displaying the HTML.  The HTML files have to be kept under the 'templates' directory (directory has to be named exactly that).  You call the HTML file at the end of the function using `return render_template('something.html', **templateData)` where templateData is a dictionary with variables that are listed in the index.html file as `{{ variable_name }}`.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Also, URLs can be dynamic, eg `\"/<action>\" ` where **action** could be *on* or *off* (which means the URL would be http://127.0.0.1/on etc).  Then the function can use the variable to do different things as below, see the GPIO example.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Another complication is getting data from users.  See second example.  The HTML file has the `<form>...</form>` for the fields.  The last one in this form grouping should be a submit button.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Difference between GET and POST:**  GET is used when the URL is called from the browser, and may contain the user supplied parameters appended to the end of the URL.  POST is when a submit button is clicked.  In the case of GET, you can extract the variables using, for example, `str(escape(request.args.get(\"celsius\", \"\")))`.  For POST, you get variables using `request.form(\"variable_name\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Most basic example\n",
    "\n",
    "This needs no HTML, no CSS, just the plain Python.  Note the second function with `\"/<int:celsius>\"`.  The angle bracket syntax (<>) tells Flask to capture any text following the base URL (\"/\") and pass it on to the function  as the variable celsius. Note that `fahrenheit_from()` function requires celsius as an input.  Adding `int:` before the variable name adds input validation, tells Flask to check whether the input it receives from the URL can be converted to an integer. If it can, then the content is passed on to fahrenheit_from(). If it canâ€™t, then Flask displays a Not Found error page.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So http://127.0.0.1/42 converts 42 celsius to fahrenheit.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route(\"/\")\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "    return \"Congratulations, it's a web app!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route(\"/<int:celsius>\")\n",
    "def fahrenheit_from(celsius):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit degrees.\"\"\"\n",
    "    fahrenheit = float(celsius) * 9 / 5 + 32\n",
    "    fahrenheit = round(fahrenheit, 3)  # Round to three decimal places\n",
    "    return str(fahrenheit)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run(host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=80, debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "You can also insert a form right in the function itself without using a HTML file.  In the index function above, use the below for return.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.route(\"/\")\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "    return \"\"\"<form action=\"\" method=\"get\">\n",
    "                <input type=\"text\" name=\"celsius\">\n",
    "                <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Convert\">\n",
    "              </form>\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First example with HTML template\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Controlling GPIO\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, going to a URL kicks off the function that changes the value of the GPIO pin and makes the LED on or off.  These URLs can be hyperlinked to make the 'buttons' for turning the LED on or off. (or hyperlinked in an image, which I didn't try.)  \n",
